# basic-info-site

A simple node server that serves pages which correspond to the following routes:

1. `localhost:8080/` - takes user to index.html
2. `localhost:8080/about` - takes user to about.html
3. `localhost:8080/contact-me` - takes user to contact-me.html

Any route not listed above will take the user to 404.html.

Be sure to run `npm i` in the directory of the repository.
